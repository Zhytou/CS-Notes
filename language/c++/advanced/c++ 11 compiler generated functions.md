# C++ 11 Compiler Generated Functions

In C++ 03, compiler will generate functions for class, which include :

1. default constructor (generated only if no constructor is declared by user)
2. copy constructor (generated only if 5, 6 are not  declared by user)
3. copy assignment operator (generated only if 5, 6 are not declared by user)
4. destructor

In C++ 11, there are two more functions may be generated by compilers, which are

5. move constructor (generated only if 2, 3, 4, 6 are not declared by user)
6. move assignment operator (generated only if 2, 3, 4, 5 are not declared by user)

``` c++
class node{
public:
    node();				//default constructor
    node(const node&);	//copy constructor
    node(node&&);		//move constructor
    ~node();			//destructor
    
    node& operator=(const node&); //copy assignment operator
    node& operator=(node&&);	//move assignment operator
}
```
